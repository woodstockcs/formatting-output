- [format function]()

### Part 2: Exploration
1. Open up the [cs50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io).
1. If you're not already in your `unit_5` directory, `cd` into it.
1. Make a new file called `formatting.py`, then open that file.
1. Find your paper copy of the packet called "Formatting Output". (It looks like [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19GsjtFKDOCa8q35DEO2cM2CfCArZTWn8))
1. Work on that packet, writing all the mentioned code in your new file, and running the file when you need to. IMPORTANT: As you move along in the packet, comment out code that you don't need anymore, **don't delete it**! When you are done with the packet, your python file should contain all of the code mentioned in the packet.
1. When the packet tells you to write code in "the interpreter", go to the command line and just type `python`. This will give you a `>>>` prompt, using `exit()` to get out the python interpreter and back to the regular command prompt.

### Part 3: Mastery Check
1. Go back to this assignment in the google classroom and open up the attachment called "Mastery Check: Formatting Output".
1. Complete the task described in there, then press 'Turn in'.
